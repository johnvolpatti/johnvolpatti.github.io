			<h1>about</h1>
				<p> Hi. I'm John Volpatti. I attend De La Salle College and am currently in grade 12. I have applied to engineering for the 2018-2019 school year. <br><br> </p>
				<h3><strong>What I love</strong></h3>
				<p>I love working and collaborating on all things mechanical<!--/mechatronic-->. I also like playing drums in my band, chowing down on some noodles, and longboarding. <br><br> </p>

				<h3><strong>Work Experience</strong></h3>
				<p>This past summer I was a Recreational Program Volunteer at the Ontraio Science Centre. During this time, I was responsible for helping campers engage with each other while making sure they were following instructions. <br><br></p>
